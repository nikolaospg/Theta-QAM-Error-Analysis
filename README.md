This is a simulation of a telecommunication system. 
It is about a 16-thetaQAM modulation scheme, on the hypothesis of an AWGN channel with no bandwidth limitation.
The detector works with symbol by symbol detection, and applies the ML criterion(minimun euclidian distance) for detecting.
In the project, we calculate the SER and BER for various theta angles and for various SNR and in the end we make some graphs too.
